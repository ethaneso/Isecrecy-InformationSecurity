# Asset Retirement

When an asset comes to the end of its lifecycle, the asset will be disposed. This needs to be recorded in the write-off record. There are removal processes which record with details in terms of the device modal / serial number, removal date, and contact person.&#x20;

More importantly, it is the secure disposition process. The asset needs to be tracked to ensure proper approval and prevent unauthorised disclosed. Once the asset is marked for disposal, all data should be securely sanitised. A sanitisation checklist and flow can ensure the media sanitisation controls.&#x20;
