# Change Management

A Change Management program states the configuration standards and tracking the change management process.&#x20;

What is the base line for system configuration standard?

A common practice is to adopt industry or vendor standard for customisation.&#x20;

The change management program should cover all possible systems recorded in asset inventory.&#x20;

A configuration change detection and alerting process should be in place to response to the unauthorised change and remediate the potential unauthorised access.&#x20;
