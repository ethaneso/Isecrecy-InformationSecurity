# 1. Security Policy & Standards

A cyber security framework helps to design and develop policy and standards. This could begin from an industry standard and adopt the framework for an enterprise's own use to cater its organisational security needs. e.g. ISO/IEC 27001.&#x20;

While developing the cyber security framework, various parties have to be involved. These include Technology Organisations, different Business Units, Corporate Departments (e.g. HR, Legal), and third party contractors.
