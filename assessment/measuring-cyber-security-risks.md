# Measuring Cyber Security Risks

### Mean Time to Detect (MTTD)

#### How long do security threats / indicators of compromised get noticed?

Indicators of compromise

* Unusual outbound network traffic
* Anomalies in privileged user account activity
* Geographical irregularities
* Bruteforce attempts
* Increased database read volume
* HTML response sizes
* Large number of requests for the same file
* Mismatched port-application traffic
* Suspicious registry / system file changes
* DNS request anomalies
* Unexpected patching of systems
* Device settings changes
* Aggregated data in the wrong place
* Web traffic with unhuman behaviour
* DDoS attacks
* Changes in security rating
* Exposed credentials
* Changes in vendor security ratings

### Mean Time to Resolve (MTTR)

#### What is the mean time to response to a cyber attack?

#### What is the incident response plan?

###

### Mean Time to Contain (MTTC)

#### How long does it take to isolate an identified attack vectors?

Common attack vectors

* Compromised credentials
* Weak passwords
* Insider threats
* Missing Encryption
* Misconfiguration
* Ransomware
* Phishing
* Vulnerabilities
* Brute Force
* DDoS
* SQL Injections
* Trojans
* XSS
* Session Hijacking
* Man-in-the-middle attacks
* Data breaches caused by vendors
