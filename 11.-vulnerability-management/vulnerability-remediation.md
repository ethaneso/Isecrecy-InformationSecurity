# Vulnerability Remediation

Timely response is required to remediate vulnerabilities identified. A signification indicator is the repeated vulnerability scanned. A high frequency of repeated vulnerability identified indicates the timeliness of the vulnerability being fixed.

To quickly respond to vulnerability, a vulnerability prioritisation framework will help prioritise the critical / high risk vulnerability. The quicker the critical risks being mitigated enhance the system security.&#x20;
